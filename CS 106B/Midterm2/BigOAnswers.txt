The big-O time complexity of the function...

... iterativePrinting is O(n^2),
    and I know this because...
    The run time is growing at a linear rate as n grows





... iterativePQ is O(nlogn),
    and I know this because...
    The run time is growing at a linear rate as n grows




... iterativeHashSet is O(n),
    and I know this because...





... iterativeLooping is O(1),
    and I know this because...





... iterativeVector is O(logn),
    and I know this because...
