Put your answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1:
numDisks: 5
start: 'A'
finish: 'C'
temp: 'B'
totalMoves: 4546550


Q2:
found in file: TowersOfHanoiGUI.cpp
under function named: makeTheMagicHappen()


Q3:
It took 31 moves to complete


Q4:
the value of totalMoves is 15


Q5:

2 characters triggers an error

Q6:
The extra character was a "=" in
Set<string> thisOption = permutationsRec(remaining, chosen + ch); on line 41


Q7:
This equals sign causes an error in the program because the
x += y function is used to alter x while + makes a new value of x+y.
Because this code is taking place within a for loop, this means that
the value for chosen, and therefore the input into the recursive function
is getting manipulated to include more and more items (+ char) each time
around the loop. This is why, for the first iteration of the for loop,
the output is correct, but after that additional characters start to appear
in the output
